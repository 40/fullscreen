fullscreen
==========
fullscreen jquery plugin to scale <video> to window size (to be used as a background), maintains aspect ratio and centers in window.

usage
=====
select the <video> tag and invoke the plugin. `$('video').fullscreen();`. your video width and height must be defined `<video width="1600" height="950">` in order to maintain aspect ratio. then a simple css definition will position your element `video { left: 0; position: fixed; top: 0; }`.
